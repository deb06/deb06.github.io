# Here are some of my projects:

**- Discord AI(ish) Bot:**

This was a fun side project I made, it's pretty basic code but I think it's pretty cool.

What the bot does is it takes all messages sent from the servers it is in and puts them in a txt file

After that, there is a chance (chance can be changed) that it will send a random message from the txt file

This can and has produced some really funny moments.

it is actually open source, and you can set it up for yourself:

**- Discord Bot:**

This is my biggest prroject so far, and I am really proud of it.

It's a more traditional Discord bot with commands, some of which use external APIs.

It was a really fun project a great lerning experience.

Here is the top.gg listing for the bot:

Overall, I enjoy coding and Discord is a good platform to code things on. The API is rather simple, and there are a lot of free toturials online
